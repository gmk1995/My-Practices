The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to setup some pre-requisites for an application that will send the greetings to different users. There is a sample deployment, that needs to be tested. Below is a scenario which needs to be configured on Kubernetes cluster. Please find below more details about it.


Create a pod named print-envars-greeting.

Configure spec as, the container name should be print-env-container and use bash image.

Create three environment variables:

a. GREETING and its value should be Welcome to

b. COMPANY and its value should be Nautilus

c. GROUP and its value should be Industries

Use command to echo ["$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"] message.

You can check the output using kubectl logs -f print-envars-greeting command.


Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

Ans)
    ## Log into the jump_host 
    1. ssh thor@jump_host

    ## Write a print-envars-greeting.yaml file
    2. 
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          creationTimestamp: null
          labels:
            run: print-envars-greeting
          name: print-envars-greeting
        spec:
          containers:
          - env:
            - name: GREETING
              value: Welcome to
            - name: COMPANY
              value: Nautilus
            - name: GROUP
              value: Industries
            image: bash
            name: print-env-container
            command: ["sh", "-c", echo "$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"]
            resources: {}
          dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
          restartPolicy: Always
        status: {}

    ## Apply the print-envars-greeting.yaml file to create print-envars-greeting pod
    3. kubectl apply -f print-envars-greeting.yaml

    ## Check the Pod is created or not
    4. kubectl get pods
       Once Pod is completed it task check the logs

    ## Checking the  print-envars-greeting pod logs whether it is print the env values or not
    5. kubectl logs -f print-envars-greeting
       we are getting response as "Welcome to Nautilus Industries"
