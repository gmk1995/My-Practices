This morning the Nautilus DevOps team rolled out a new release for one of the applications. Recently one of the customers logged a complaint which seems to be about a bug related to the recent release. Therefore, the team wants to rollback the recent release.


There is a deployment named nginx-deployment; roll it back to the previous revision.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.


Ans)

    1  kubectl get deployment
    2  kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
    3  kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=1 or kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
    4  kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
