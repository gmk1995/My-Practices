Create a YAML file named print-envars-greeting.yaml and open it in an editor:

vi print-envars-greeting.yaml

Add the following content to the file:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: print-envars-greeting
spec:
  containers:
  - name: print-env-container
    image: bash
    env:
    - name: GREETING
      value: "Welcome to"
    - name: COMPANY
      value: "DevOps"
    - name: GROUP
      value: "Industries"
    command: ["/bin/bash"]
    args: ["-c", "echo \"$GREETING $COMPANY $GROUP\""]

Save and close the file.

Apply the configuration using kubectl:


kubectl apply -f print-envars-greeting.yaml

Verify that the pod is running using:


kubectl get pods

Check the logs to verify that the environment variables are set and the message is printed:


kubectl logs -f print-envars-greeting

You should see output similar to the following:


Welcome to DevOps Industries

That's it! You have successfully created a pod with the required configurations and verified that it works correctly.
