The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to setup some pre-requisites for an application that will send the greetings to different users. There is a sample deployment, that needs to be tested. Below is a scenario which needs to be configured on Kubernetes cluster. Please find below more details about it.

Create a pod named print-envars-greeting.

Configure spec as, the container name should be print-env-container and use bash image.

Create three environment variables:

a. GREETING and its value should be Welcome to

b. COMPANY and its value should be DevOps

c. GROUP and its value should be Industries

Use command to echo ["$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"] message.

You can check the output using <kubctl logs -f [ pod-name ]> command.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
