We deployed a Nginx and PHP-FPM based setup on Kubernetes cluster last week and it had been working fine so far. This morning one of the team members made a change somewhere which caused some issues, and it stopped working. Please look into the issue and fix it:

The pod name is nginx-phpfpm and configmap name is nginx-config. Figure out the issue and fix the same.


Once issue is fixed, copy /home/thor/index.php file from the jump host to the nginx-container under nginx document root and you should be able to access the website using Website button on top bar.


Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

Ans) 
   ## Check the Pod Status
   1.  kubectl get pods

   ## Check the ConfigMap Status
   2.  kubectl get cm

   ## Describe Pod
   3.  kubectl describe pod nginx-phpfpm
   
   ## Describe ConfigMap
   4.  kubectl describe configmaps nginx-config
   
   ## Edit the Pod 
   5.  kubectl edit pod nginx-phpfpm

   ## While checking the Pod Configurations I found the nginx container volume mounts is not sharing the root path
   ## Added root path(/var/www/html/) in the Pod Configuration file
   ## Saved the file in the /tmp/kubectl-edit-2326372287.yaml

   ## Saved kubectl-edit-2326372287.yaml file apply again to fix the issue
   6. kubectl replace --force -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-2326372287.yaml

   ## Check the pod status again
   7.  kubectl get pods
   
   ## Copying /home/thor/index.php to nginx container from jump_host
   8.  kubectl cp index.php nginx-phpfpm:/var/www/html/ -c nginx-container

   ## Checking if you are able to access the PHP Website or not by Running the IPAddress&Port Number.
   ## Website is accessing now.
