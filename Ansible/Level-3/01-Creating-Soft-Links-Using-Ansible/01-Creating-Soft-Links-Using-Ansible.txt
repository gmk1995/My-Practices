The Nautilus DevOps team is practicing some of the Ansible modules and creating and testing different Ansible playbooks to accomplish tasks. Recently they started testing an Ansible file module to create soft links on all app servers. Below you can find more details about it.



Write a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host, an inventory file is already present under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host itself. Using this playbook accomplish below given tasks:


Create an empty file /opt/data/blog.txt on app server 1; its user owner and group owner should be tony. Create a symbolic link of source path /opt/data to destination /var/www/html.


Create an empty file /opt/data/story.txt on app server 2; its user owner and group owner should be steve. Create a symbolic link of source path /opt/data to destination /var/www/html.


Create an empty file /opt/data/media.txt on app server 3; its user owner and group owner should be banner. Create a symbolic link of source path /opt/data to destination /var/www/html.


Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.

Ans)

    ## Check the all app servers are in online or not 
    1. ansible -i inventory -m ping all

    ## Create the ansible playbook
    2. vi playbook.yml

    ## Run the Playbook
    3. ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml

    ## Playbook is executed successfully, we need to verify files and symbolic link is created or not in all app servers
    4. ansible -i inventory -m shell -ba "ls -larth /opt/data" all && ansible -i inventory -m shell -ba "ls -larth /var/www/html" all
       Empty Files are created and symbolic links also created successfully
