The Nautilus DevOps team is testing applications containerization, which issupposed to be migrated on docker container-based environments soon. In today's stand-up meeting one of the team members has been assigned a task to create and test a docker container with certain requirements. Below are more details:


a. On App Server 1 in Stratos DC pull nginx image (preferably latest tag but others should work too).


b. Create a new container with name demo from the image you just pulled.


c. Map the host volume /opt/finance with container volume /usr/src/. There is an sample.txt file present on same server under /tmp; copy that file to /opt/finance. Also please keep the container in running state.

Ans)
    ## Log into the App Server 1
    1. ssh tony@stapp01

    ## Pull the nginx:latest image from Docker Repository
    2. docker pull nginx:latest

    ## Check the docker images
    3. docker images

    ## Create the container demo and map the host volume
    4. docker run -d --name demo -v /opt/finance:/usr/src nginx:latest

    ## Check the docker container
    5. docker ps

    ## Copy the /tmp/sample.txt to /opt/finance directory
    6. cp /tmp/sample.txt /opt/finance

    ## Check the sample.txt is in the container /usr/src directory or not as it is share host volume
    7. docker exec -it demo /bin/bash && ls -larth /usr/src
