One of the DevOps team members was working on to create a new custom docker image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC. He is done with his changes and image is saved on same server with name apps:xfusion. Recently a requirement has been raised by a team to use that image for testing, but the team wants to test the same on App Server 3. So we need to provide them that image on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.


a. On App Server 1 save the image apps:xfusion in an archive.


b. Transfer the image archive to App Server 3.


c. Load that image archive on App Server 3 with same name and tag which was used on App Server 1.


Note: Docker is already installed on both servers; however, if its service is down please make sure to start it.

Ans)
    ## Log into tha app server1
    1. ssh tony@stapp01

    ## Check the docker images 
    2. docker images

    ## save the image apps:xfusion in an archive
    3. docker save --output apps-xfusion.tar apps:xfusion

    ## Check the apps-xfusion.tar file
    4. ls -larth
       Once the apps-xfusion.tar
    
    ## Copy apps-xfusion.tar file from App Server 1 to App Server 3
    5. scp apps-xfusion.tar banner@stapp03:/tmp

    ## Log into App Server 3 and Load the apps-xfusion.tar file
    6. ssh banner@stapp03

    ## Load the apps-xfusion.tar file
    7. docker load -i /tmp/apps-xfusion.tar

    ## Check the docker images in the App Server3
    8. docker images
