The Nautilus application development team shared static website content that needs to be hosted on the httpd web server using a containerised platform. The team has shared details with the DevOps team, and we need to set up an environment according to those guidelines. Below are the details:



a. On App Server 1 in Stratos DC create a container named httpd using a docker compose file /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml (please use the exact name for file).


b. Use httpd (preferably latest tag) image for container and make sure container is named as httpd; you can use any name for service.


c. Map 80 number port of container with port 6100 of docker host.


d. Map container's /usr/local/apache2/htdocs volume with /opt/security volume of docker host which is already there. (please do not modify any data within these locations).

Ans)
    ## Log into the App Server1
    1. ssh tony@stapp01

    ## Create the docker-compose.yml file
    2. vi /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml
       version: '3'
       services:
         httpd:
           image: httpd:latest
           container_name: httpd
           volumes:
             - /opt/security:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs
           ports:
             - 6100:80

    ## Create the container with docker-compose.yml file
    3. docker-compose up -d 

    ## Check the image is created or not
    4. docker images

    ## Check is container is created or not 
    5. docker ps

    ## Check the container with docker-compose
    6. docker-compose ps

    ## Check the response of the httpd web server
    7. curl -I localhost:6100
       Response 200 OK will be considered as web server is up and running
