xFusionCorp Industries uses some monitoring tools to check the status of every service, application, etc running on the systems. Recently, the monitoring system identified that Apache service is not running on some of the Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos Datacenter.



1. Identify the faulty Nautilus Application Server and fix the issue. Also, make sure Apache service is up and running on all Nautilus Application Servers. Do not try to stop any kind of firewall that is already running.


2. Apache is running on 3000 port on all Nautilus Application Servers and its document root must be /var/www/html on all app servers.


3. Finally you can test from jump host using curl command to access Apache on all app servers and it should be reachable and you should get some static page. E.g. curl http://172.16.238.10:3000/.

Ans)
    ## Log into the App server 1
    1. ssh tony@stapp01

    ## Check the status of the Apache Server
    2. systemctl status httpd
       Here httpd server is not running and it is failed status need to check the httpd.conf file

    ## Checking the httpd.conf file syntax
    3. apachectl configtest
       There are syntax error in "ServerRoot and DocumentRoot" 

    ## Correcting the syntax errors in httpd.conf file
    4. sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
       Before ServerRoot "/etc/httpd;" Corrected ServerRoot "/etc/httpd"
       Before DocumentRoot "/var/www/html;" Corrected DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
       and Saved the file

    ## Checking the httpd.conf file syntax
    5. apachectl configtest
       This time syntax is ok

    ## Restarting, Status and Enabling the httpd server
    6. sudo systemctl restart httpd &&  sudo systemctl status httpd && sudo systemctl enable httpd
       Now httpd service is up and running
    
    ## Checking App Server 1 Apache server is access or not from Jump Server
