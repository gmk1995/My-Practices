To secure our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter we have decided to install and configure firewalld on all app servers. We have Apache and Nginx services running on these apps. Nginx is running as a reverse proxy server for Apache. We might have more robust firewall settings in the future, but for now we have decided to go with the given requirements listed below:



a. Allow all incoming connections on Nginx port, i.e 80.

b. Block all incoming connections on Apache port, i.e 8080.

c. All rules must be permanent.

d. Zone should be public.

e. If Apache or Nginx services aren't running already, please make sure to start them.

Ans)
    ## Log in App Server 1
    1. ssh tony@stapp01

    ## Install the firewalld
    2. yum install firewalld -y

    ## Start the firewalld 
    3. systemctl start firewalld

    ## Enable the status firewalld
    4. systemctl enable firewalld

    ## Allow all incoming connections on Nginx port, i.e 80.
    5. sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=80/tcp

    ## Block all incoming connections on Apache port, i.e 8080.
    6. sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --remove-port=8080/tcp

    ## Starting, Enabling and Checking Status of Nginx
    7. sudo systemctl start nginx && sudo systemctl enable nginx && sudo systemctl status nginx

    ## Starting, Enabling and Checking Status of Nginx
    8. sudo systemctl start httpd && sudo systemctl enable httpd && sudo systemctl status httpd

    ## Perform Same Steps in remaining Two servers
