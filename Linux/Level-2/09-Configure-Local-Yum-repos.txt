32) Configure Local Yum repos

The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.

a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named local_yum and make sure to set Repository ID to local_yum. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package samba from this newly created repo.

Ans) Create a directory to store the repository metadata. In this case, we will create a directory named "local_yum" under the "/etc/yum.repos.d/" directory.

sudo mkdir /etc/yum.repos.d/local_yum

Create a new repository configuration file for the local yum repository. You can use any text editor to create this file. For example, you can use the "vi" editor.

sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/local_yum/local_yum.repo

In the editor, add the following lines to the repository configuration file:

[local_yum]
name=Local Yum Repository
baseurl=file:///packages/downloaded_rpms/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

Here, we have set the "baseurl" to the location of the downloaded RPMs on Nautilus Backup Server, which is "/packages/downloaded_rpms/". We have also enabled the repository by setting "enabled" to 1, and disabled GPG checking by setting "gpgcheck" to 0.

Save and close the repository configuration file.

Update the yum repository metadata to make the local yum repository available for package installation.

sudo yum makecache --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=local_yum

Now, you can install the "samba" package from the local yum repository.

sudo yum install samba --enablerepo=local_yum

This will install the "samba" package from the local yum repository named "local_yum" on Nautilus Backup Server.
