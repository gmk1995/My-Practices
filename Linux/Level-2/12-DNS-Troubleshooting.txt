12) The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution in several apps . App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.
As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS (ipv4). Please make appropriate changes on this server.

Ans) Open the /etc/resolv.conf file with a text editor (e.g., nano or vi).

Add the following line at the top of the file:
nameserver 8.8.8.8
This adds Google public DNS (IPv4) as the first DNS nameserver to use.
Save and close the file.
Restart the network service to apply the changes:
sudo systemctl restart network
Alternatively, you can reboot the server to ensure that the changes take effect after the reboot:
sudo reboot
Note: The changes made in /etc/resolv.conf are not persistent across reboots. You may need to modify the appropriate configuration file for your Linux distribution to make the changes persistent. For example, on CentOS/RHEL, you can modify the PEERDNS setting in the network configuration file (/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface>) to ensure that the additional DNS nameserver is added after reboot.
