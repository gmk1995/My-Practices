This will install Tomcat and its dependencies on your system.

To configure log rotation for Tomcat on CentOS, you can follow these steps:

Install logrotate package:


sudo yum install logrotate

This will install the logrotate package on your system.

Create a logrotate configuration file for Tomcat:


sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/tomcat
Add the following contents to the file:


/var/log/tomcat/*.log {
    monthly
    rotate 3
    compress
    delaycompress
    missingok
    notifempty
    create 640 tomcat tomcat
}
This configuration will rotate Tomcat logs on a monthly basis, keep only 3 rotated logs, compress the rotated logs, and create new empty logs with correct file permissions.

Save the file and exit the editor.

Test the logrotate configuration:

sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/tomcat

This will force logrotate to rotate logs based on the configuration file you just created.
