16) The system admin team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed an issue with some servers in Stratos Datacenter where some of the servers are not in sync w.r.t time. Because of this, several application functionalities have been impacted. To fix this issue the team has started using common/standard NTP servers. They are finished with most of the servers except App Server 2. Therefore, perform the following tasks on this server:

Install and configure NTP server on App Server 2.

Add NTP server 3.south-america.pool.ntp.org in NTP configuration on App Server 2.

Please do not try to start/restart/stop ntp service, as we already have a restart for this service scheduled for tonight and we don't want these changes to be applied right now.

Ans) Log into the App Server 2 by using " ssh username@hostname/ipaddress
      >> Check the os flavor bby running the command " sudo /etc/os-release "
      >> Once os flavor is comfirmed you can run the command by using the preferred package manager " yum install ntp -y or suod apt install ntp -y "
      >> Open the ntp config by running the command " sudo vi /etc/ntp.conf"
      >> Add " 3.south-america.pool.ntp.org " on below lines " # Use public servers from the pool.ntp.org project.# Please consider joining the pool (http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html) "
      >> As it mentioned we don't need to restart the ntp service.
