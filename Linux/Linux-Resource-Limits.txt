On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:



a. soft limit = 1027


b. hard_limit = 2027

Ans)
    ## Log into the storage server
    1. ssh natasha@ststor01

    ## Switch to root user
    2. sudo -i

    ## Open the limits.conf file to set soft and hard limits
    3. vi /etc/security/limits.conf
        ## Add Below content in the limits.conf file 
        @nfsuser          soft    nproc           1027
        @nfsuser          hard    nproc           2027

    ## If you want to see the limits of a certain process has you can simply “cat” the limits file like this:
    4. cat /proc/PID/limits
