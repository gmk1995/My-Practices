To stick with the security compliances, the Nautilus project team has decided to apply some restrictions on crontab access so that only allowed users can create/update the cron jobs. Limit crontab access to below specified users on App Server 2.



Allow crontab access to jim user and deny the same to ryan user.

Ans)
    ## Log into the App Server
    1. ssh steve@stapp02

    ## Switch to Root User
    2. sudo -i or sudo su -

    ## Check whether crond services are up and running or not
    3. systemctl status crond

    ## Create two file cron.allow and cron.deny in /etc directory
    4. vi /etc/cron.allow and add "jim"
       vi /etc/cron.deny and add "ryan"

    ## Restart and Status check the crond services
    5. systemctl restart crond    
       systemctl status crond

    ## Switch to the ryan user and jim user to check whether they have access to crontab or not
    6. su - ryan \ 
       crontab -e  
       ## You will receive error message as we have added them in cron.deny

       su - jim \
       crontab -e 
       ## A vi editor will open to schedule the cronjob
