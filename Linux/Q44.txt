44) Web Server Security

During a recent security audit, the application security team of xFusionCorp Industries found security issues with the Apache web server on Nautilus App Server 3 server in Stratos DC. They have listed several security issues that need to be fixed on this server. Please apply the security settings below:

a. On Nautilus App Server 3 it was identified that the Apache web server is exposing the version number. Ensure this server has the appropriate settings to hide the version number of the Apache web server.

b. There is a website hosted under /var/www/html/beta on App Server 3. It was detected that the directory /beta lists all of its contents while browsing the URL. Disable the directory browser listing in Apache config.

c. Also make sure to restart the Apache service after making the changes.

Ans) Log into the app server 3 via ssh " ssh username@IPaddress/HostName "

To hide the Apache version number, you need to edit the Apache configuration file. Open the terminal and run the following command:

sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Add the following lines at the end of the file:

ServerSignature Off
ServerTokens Prod

To disable directory browsing, you need to edit the Apache configuration file again. Open the terminal and run the following command:

sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Find the section for the directory /var/www/html/beta and add the following line:

Options -Indexes

Save the file and exit.

c. To restart the Apache service, run the following command:

sudo systemctl restart httpd

If the /var/www/html/beta directory is not listed in the httpd.conf file, you can create a new configuration file specifically for the /var/www/html/beta directory. Here's how you can do it:

Create a new configuration file for the /var/www/html/beta directory:

sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/beta.conf

Add the following lines to the new configuration file to disable directory browsing:


<Directory /var/www/html/beta>
    Options -Indexes
</Directory>
Save the file and exit.

Restart the Apache service to apply the changes:

sudo systemctl restart httpd

Now, the directory browsing for /var/www/html/beta should be disabled.

This will apply the changes you made to the Apache configuration.

That's it! Your Apache web server on Nautilus App Server 3 should now be more secure.
