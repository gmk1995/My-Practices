31) Setup SSL for Nginx

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries needs to deploy a new application on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. They have some pre-requites to get ready that server for application deployment. Prepare the server as per requirements shared below:

Install and configure nginx on App Server 3.

On App Server 3 there is a self signed SSL certificate and key present at location /tmp/nautilus.crt and /tmp/nautilus.key. Move them to some appropriate location and deploy the same in Nginx.

Create an index.html file with content Welcome! under Nginx document root.

For final testing try to access the App Server 3 link (either hostname or IP) from jump host using curl command. For example curl -Ik https://<app-server-ip>/.

Ans) yum install epel-release -y
yum install nginx -y ;
systemctl start nginx ;
systemctl enable nginx
mkdir -vp /etc/nginx/ssl
mv /tmp/nautilus.crt /etc/nginx/ssl/
mv /tmp/nautilus.key /etc/nginx/ssl/
mkdir -vp /var/www/html
touch /var/www/html/index.html
echo 'Welcome!' | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
systemctl restart nginx ;
curl -Ik http:///
we will be able to access site.
Now uncomment below lines only in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
Settings for a TLS enabled server.
