36) IPtables Installation And Configuration

We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apacheâ€™s port i.e 6300 is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following requirements:

Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host.

Block incoming port 6300 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.

Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.

Ans) Log in App servers by using ssh " ssh username@HostName/IPaddress "

Install iptables and its dependencies by running the following command:


sudo yum install iptables

Create a new iptables rule to block incoming traffic on port 6300, except for the IP address of the LBR host. Run the following command:


sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6300 ! -s <LBR_IP_ADDRESS> -j DROP

Replace <LBR_IP_ADDRESS> with the actual IP address of your load balancer.

Save the current iptables rules to a file by running the following command:


sudo iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables

			[ or ]
			
sudo service iptables save

Edit the iptables configuration file to make sure the rules are loaded after system reboot. Run the following command:


sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/iptables-config
Change the value of the IPTABLES_SAVE_ON_STOP variable to yes and the value of the IPTABLES_SAVE_ON_RESTART variable to yes.

Restart the iptables service to apply the new rules:


sudo systemctl restart iptables

Now, incoming traffic on port 6300 will be blocked for everyone except for the IP address of the LBR host, and the iptables rules will be loaded automatically after system reboot.
