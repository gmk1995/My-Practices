Git Clone Repositories
Git Clone Repositories:
DevOps team created a new Git repository last week; however, as of now no team is using it. The Nautilus application development team recently asked for a copy of that repo on Storage server in Stratos DC. Please clone the repo as per details shared below:


The repo that needs to be cloned is /opt/ecommerce.git

Clone this git repository under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos directory. Please do not try to make any changes in repo.

Ans)
Open a terminal or SSH into the server where the cloning needs to be done.

Navigate to the /usr/src/kodekloudrepos directory using the following command:

cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos

Clone the repository using the git clone command with the repository path:

git clone /opt/ecommerce.git

This command will create a new directory named ecommerce under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos and clone the repository into it.
Wait for the cloning process to complete. Once finished, you will have a copy of the repository in the desired location.
Remember, since you mentioned not to make any changes in the repository, please ensure that you don't modify any files within the cloned repository.
