The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog present on Storage server in Stratos DC. This was just a test repository and one of the developers just pushed a couple of changes for testing, but now they want to clean this repository along with the commit history/work tree, so they want to point back the HEAD and the branch itself to a commit with message add data.txt file. Find below more details:



In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog git repository, reset the git commit history so that there are only two commits in the commit history i.e initial commit and add data.txt file.
