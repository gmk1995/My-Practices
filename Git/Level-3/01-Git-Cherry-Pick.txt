The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/demo.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with the DevOps team:



There are two branches in this repository, master and feature. One of the developers is working on the feature branch and their work is still in progress, however they want to merge one of the commits from the feature branch to the master branch, the message for the commit that needs to be merged into master is Update info.txt. Accomplish this task for them, also remember to push your changes eventually.

Ans) 
    ## Log into the Storage Server
    1. ssh natasha@ststor01

    ## Move to the Git cloned Path
    2. cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo

    ## Check the branches 
    3. git branch 

    ## Pull the code from the master branch if any new adding have added on web recently
    4. git pull origin master

    ## Checkout to feature branch to copy the commit hash
    5. git checkout feature

    ## Check the git commit logs on feature branch
    6. git log

    ## checkout to master branch to merge the feature branch commit 
    7. git checkout master

    ## Merge the feature branch commit with master branch
    8. git cherry-pick commithash

    ## Check the master branch commits once
    9. git log
       Once you see the feature commit is already there now we can push the changes in master to origin

    ## Pushing the changes to the origin
    10. git push origin -uf "master"
