Linux Questions:

1) Create a user named ammar with a non-interactive shell on the App Server 3

Ans) use -s for shell and set shell to /sbin/nologin useradd ammar -s /sbin/nologin

2) Please give executable permissions to /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 1. Also make sure every user can execute it.

Ans) sudo chmod -R 777 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

3) During the daily standup, it was pointed out that the timezone across Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos Datacenter doesn't match with that of the local datacenter's timezone, which is America/Managua. Correct the mismatch.

Ans) run sudo timedatectl to check the timezone
sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/Managua

4) The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:

a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.

b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.

Ans) Log into application servers using "ssh username@ipaddress/hostname"
      >> check the which Linux Flavour is Installed by running the command " sudo cat /etc/os-release
      >> Once you confirm the os version check the package is available or not by running " sudo yum search cronie or apt search cronie "
      >> Once Package is available you can run the following commands to install the Squid Package by running the command " sudo yum install cronie -y or sudo apt install cronie -y "
      >> Once the Package is installed sucessfully you need to restart the service to run in the background " sudo systemctl restart crond "
      >> Check the status of the cronie service by running the below command " sudo systemctl status crond "
      >> To Add a cronjob you need run the below command " crontab -e -u root "
      >> It will open a vi editor you need to paste the above cronjob " */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text " and save the file

      >> Create BSD_DELETE.txt BSD_REPLACE.txt on /home directory by running the command " sudo touch BSD_DELETE.txt BSD_REPLACE.txt " and provide read,write,execute permissions by running the command " sudo chmod 777 BSD_DELETE.txt BSD_REPLACE.txt ".
      >> Use the Command " sudo grep -v copyright  /home/BSD.txt > /home/BSD_DELETE.txt
      >> Use the Command " sudo sed 's/\band\b/is/g' /home/BSD.txt > /home/BSD_REPLACE.txt

7)  create a user named ravi on the App Server 1. Set expiry date to 2021-04-15 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

Ans) Log into application servers using "ssh username@ipaddress/hostname"
      >> Once you log into the App Server 1 you need to run the below command " sudo useradd -m -e 2021-04-15 ravi "
      >> -m = create the user's home directory
      >> -e = expiration date of the new account

8) On App Server 1 find all files (not directories) owned by user jim inside /home/usersdata directory and copy them all while keeping the folder structure (preserve the directories path) to /beta directory.

Ans) Log into App Server1 using "ssh username@ipaddress/hostname"

      >> Once you confirm back the user home directory by running the command " cd ~ " 
      >> To copy jim user files inside /home/usersdata directory  and to keep the folder structure you need to run the below command " sudo find /home/usersdata -type f -user jim -exec cp --parents {} /beta \;
      >> This command finds all files owned by user "jim" inside the /home/usersdata directory on App Server 1, using the find command with the following options:
          ** -type f: Find only files, not directories.
          ** -user jim: Find files owned by the user "jim".
          ** -exec cp --parents {} /beta \;: Execute the cp command on each file found, copying the file to the /beta directory while preserving the directory structure.
